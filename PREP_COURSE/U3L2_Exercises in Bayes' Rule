A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers. Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the test will:

1. Be positive
0.005*0.98+0.995*0.1
2. Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
0.98
3. Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
0.9
4. Misclassify the person
0.005*0.02+0.995*0.1
