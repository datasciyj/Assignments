# Evaluating Data sources
In each of the scenarios, find possible shortcomings of the theoretical or actual data sources to answer the given question. What could be done to either adjust the analysis or reframe the question so that you can answer it accurately?

**Data Source**: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. 
**Question**: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?

The situation under which data was collected is exceptional. The date of the data is right before Christmas, thus the data can be skewed in this exceptional situation. In addition, since the data are brought only from AirBnB, the data might not enough to represent entire neighborhood in Amsterdam. Thus, I would change the question to limit our scope. It could be 'What are the popular neighborhoods for AirBnB in Amsterdam on December 24th'. 
 

**Data Source**: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. 
**Question**: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?

The date when the data were collected is the right next day of 911, so the situation is exceptional for the data in NY. People in NY must have had traumatic experience on 911, thus a lot more people might have used mental health service on the next day than usual days. So this exceptional situation in NY might cause biased results. Considering this possibility, the question could be limited by including the date and region information. Thus, the new question could be as follows: ' How do patterns of mental health service use vary between NY and CA on the next day of 911 terror attacks?'      

**Data Source**: Armenian Pub Survey. 
**Question**: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?

When looking into the survey, most of the respondents are under 23 and most of their occupation are students. Thus, the sample of the data might be biased, and cannot represent the entire population (Armenians) properly.   In this case, we could collect more data from the people who are in other age ranges and have other occupations.
