Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type.

However, our company has five sites in different countries, and it is difficult to assess and manage workers' satisfaction. Since HR and IT are the two largest department in our company, it is important to obtain data from these two first in different countries."
