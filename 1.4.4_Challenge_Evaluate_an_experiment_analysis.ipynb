    "** 1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used. **\n",

    "> The experimenter could affect the results unconciously, thus the experimenter should not know about the hypothesis. In addition, it is better that the same experimenter conduct all the conditions. The participants here are captured droids, so they tend to act following the intention of the experimenter. This also could affect the results, so there need to be no conflict of interest. "

    "** 2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future. **\n",
    "\n",
    "> There might have been a Simpson's paradox here. Like data for Berkely graduate admissions in 1975, if the planets which Windu visited have many more people than that of Jar Jar only in the place where the rate was very low but better than Jar Jar, Windu has a better success rate on every planet but entire avereage could be lower than Jar Jar. It is also possible that Windu only visited unfriendly planets, so it was more difficult to change people's attitude for Windu. I would assign Jar Jar and Windu to 2 friendly and 2 unfriendly planets for each, and make them speak to the exact same number of people.    \n",
