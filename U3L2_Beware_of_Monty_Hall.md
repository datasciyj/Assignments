# 1. Beware of Monty Hall
  When making this problem simple, it is to choose one of three or two of three. Everytime I choose one of the three doors, Monty opens another door which has always a goat. The probability that the door that I chose has a car is 1/3, and the probability that one of the remaining doors has a car is 2/3. Since Monty always notify which door has a goat among the remaining doors, changing my first choice to the other door is 2/3 to have a car in it and is always better than not to change. Again, this problem can be simplified as choosing one door or two doors at once because Monty always opens the wrong door for us, and it is always better to choose opening two doors at once.
